During the DSHI course, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
Using a Kaggle dataset combining five major heart disease datasets, I worked with 918 patient records and 16 demographic and clinical features, including age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate.
After cleaning and exploring the data, I tested several classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
KNN with k=7 delivered the best F1-score, making it the most effective at balancing precision and recall.
